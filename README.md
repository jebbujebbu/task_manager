# Task Manager Web App

A simple and responsive web application for managing your tasks. You can add, edit, delete, filter, and sort tasks by priority, due date, and name. All data is saved locally in your browser.

## Features

- Add new tasks with priority (High, Normal, Low) and optional due date
- Inline edit task name, due date, and priority directly in the list
- Live search: filter tasks by name as you type
- Automatically sorts tasks by: priority â†’ due date â†’ alphabetical
- Delete individual tasks or clear all at once
- Saves tasks in **local storage**
- Responsive and minimalist design (with custom CSS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task_manager.git
